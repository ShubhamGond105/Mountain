            <p>mountain, landform that rises prominently above its surroundings, generally exhibiting steep slopes, a
                relatively confined summit area, and considerable local relief. Mountains generally are understood to be
                larger than hills, but the term has no standardized geological meaning. Very rarely do mountains occur
                individually.</p>

    <h2>Why Mountains?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Mountains are arguably Earth's most striking features. They play a major role in determining global and regional
        climates, are the source of most rivers, act as cradles, barriers and bridges for species, and are crucial for
        the survival and sustainability of many human societies.</p>

    <h3>This is the reasion</h3>
    <p>One of the defining features of Planet Earth is plate tectonics, a process that created both the highest
        mountains on land and the deepest troughs in the ocean. Because of this process continents have arrived in their
        present arrangement. Without plate tectonics our planet would be a largely static, flat, dull surface. This
        mechanism is thus a cornerstone in promoting the diversification of life on Earth (Dietrich & Perron, 2006;
        Lammer et al., 2010; Rahbek et al., 2019; Spohn & Breuer, 2016; Stern, 2016).</p>

            <h1>Why I Love Mountains?</h1>
            <p>I love mountains and I go there; to feel nothing-ness, to feel Life's fragility. To realise the
                importance of having less strings in life. To feel how tiny I am after watching night sky, so many
                stars. All these things leads to joy in my life directly/indirectly.

                I know, I'm being too philosophical but for me this is the truth or maybe I am out of words to describe
                that emotion.</p>

            <h1>Why People Love Mountains?</h1>
            <p>As a child I spent a year living in a small abandoned village in the French Alps with my mother and
                another family. We were self-sufficient, with no electricity, plumbing, or any other modern
                conveniences. Our deliciously sweet and pure water came from a natural spring, and our food was mainly
                grown and sourced from the mountain. Living there was a life-changing experience from which my love of
                mountains grew.

                These days I don't get to visit mountains very often, but when I do, the memories and feelings come
                flooding back. If you haven't spent time in mountain areas, I urge you to do so, there is nothing like
                it.
